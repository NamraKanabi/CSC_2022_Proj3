Program essentially takes in data for a school library and sorts it.
It takes four text files as input (books.txt, borrowers.txt, returns.txt, students.txt) and outputs one text file (standing.txt).

The four inputs must be formatted as below:
books.txt: [list of books in library]
BOOKID#BOOKNAME#AUTHOR#PRICE

borrowers.txt: [list of books borrowed]
BOOKID;STUDENTID;BORROWDATE;RETURNDATE

returns.txt: [list of books returned]
BOOKID;STUDENTID;RETURNDATE;STATUS

students.txt: [list of students in school]
STUDENTID,STUDENTNAME,CLASSID

The output file will be formatted as below:
standing.txt: [sorted data of books remaining to be returned 
	       money owned by each student]
Class: [ID]
